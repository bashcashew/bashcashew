## Hi there 👋

### Here is a list of things that I am working on, but not exclussively. ;)
* Uploading a 🗣️local LLM-and-realistic-TTS Models for use in the Terminal
* Uploading a 🎮PS5-to-PC script that allows full integration of a controller into the PC environment, including controller rumble.
  * _Added local telemetric .csv data per session for usage analyses if interested -- this can be removed if no use-cases_
* Uploading a 📑PPTX-to-PDF Converter
* Uploading a 📑PDF Merger with custom footers that apply the orignial file name to help with knowing where you are
* Uploading a 📑PDF-to-text-markdown script that allows you to compile all text within a document/PDF given specified margins (ui included)
* Uploading a ✅Bubble-sort algorithm for a computer directory as well as some other sorting algos.
* Uploading a 📀script that checks physical port entries i.e., USBs, SDs, and creates a dump of easy-to-read information logs in the target drive.
* Uploading various 👨‍💻.js scripts for consumer ui into a single repository
* Uploading a 🎬cyberpunk-CLI that integrates various commands of a normal CLI such as ls, cd, alias etc. +
  + comes with a robust calculator
  + comes with a built-in video player
  + comes with a built-in text and file editor that (has retention issues atm ... so only per-session saves)
  * _These commands are done, but may be rolled out incrementtally or not at all due to some issues surrounding cohesion_
* Uploading a 🐍bash-and-python script that gives a cyberpunk-esque splash screen with a password lock for your preferred CLI.
  * all functions are disabled and only can enter the password to enter the terminal ... this can easily be edited in the bash script if issues occur.
  * The only way to exit without a password is to exit the terminal ... or again, editing the bash script :)
