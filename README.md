## Hi there 👋


**$${\color{red}UPDATE:}$$** Main focus is on private work at the moment, finished works will be incrementally updated in the respective repositories. Updates to these are not considered for now, but will be in future instances. Thank you :D
* List of finished include: all PDF codes, PS5 controller, sorting algortihms, LLM TTS UI + terminal, Bash-based splash screen, STT Model, Stable Diffusion Sana

* List of not included: Cyperpunk CLI (not in a robust place atm., ambitions to integrate a database an interactive selection-and-viewer tool inside the CLI), and USB logger and port entry tool (Not enough time to fine tune, prevent data-loss and corruption; will push at a later date)

### Here is a list of things that I am working on, but not exclussively. ;)
* Uploading a 🗣️local LLM-and-realistic-TTS Models for use in the Terminal
* Uploading a 🎮PS5-to-PC script that allows full integration of a controller into the PC environment, including controller rumble.
  * _Added local telemetric .csv data per session for usage analyses if interested -- this can be removed if no use-cases_
* Uploading a 📑PPTX-to-PDF Converter
* Uploading a 📑PDF Merger with custom footers that apply the orignial file name to help with knowing where you are
* Uploading a 📑PDF-to-text-markdown script that allows you to compile all text within a document/PDF given specified margins (ui included)
* Uploading a ✅Bubble-sort algorithm for a computer directory as well as some other sorting algos.
* Uploading a 📀script that checks physical port entries i.e., USBs, SDs, and creates a dump of easy-to-read information logs in the target drive.
* Uploading various 👨‍💻.js scripts for consumer ui into a single repository
* Uploading a 🎬cyberpunk-CLI that integrates various commands of a normal CLI such as ls, cd, alias etc. +
  + comes with a robust calculator
  + comes with a built-in video player
  + comes with a built-in text and file editor that (has retention issues atm ... so only per-session saves)
  * _These commands are done, but may be rolled out incrementtally or not at all due to some issues surrounding cohesion_
* Uploading a 🐍bash-and-python script that gives a cyberpunk-esque splash screen with a password lock for your preferred CLI.
  * all functions are disabled and only can enter the password to enter the terminal ... this can easily be edited in the bash script if issues occur.
  * The only way to exit without a password is to exit the terminal ... or again, editing the bash script :)
* Speach-to-text transcription model designed for video and sound files to convert into .md or .txt files.
* Stable Diffusion model (Sana) scripts for image generation through python.
